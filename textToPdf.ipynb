    "The document summarizes a lecture on Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST), covering key concepts, testing types, and best practices. Here’s a breakdown of the main points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NHST Overview:\n",
    "   - Introduction to core concepts like the null hypothesis, test statistics, significance level, p-value, and rejection regions.\n",
    "   - Instructions for designing a hypothesis test, choosing null and alternative hypotheses, significance levels, and understanding one-sided vs. two-sided tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Types of Statistical Tests:\n",
    "   - Common tests include Z-tests, t-tests (one-sample, two-sample, paired), and Welch’s t-test for unequal variance.\n",
    "   - F-tests for equal means and variance, Chi-squared tests for distribution fit and homogeneity, and Likelihood-ratio tests are also discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Practical Examples:\n",
    "   - Scenarios illustrate test applications, like testing class height against population average, drug effectiveness, survey bias, and drawing ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Key Concepts and Issues:\n",
    "   - P-value problems: Warnings about p-hacking, low power experiments, and misconceptions, such as assuming p-values indicate effect size.\n",
    "   - FWER and FDR: Techniques to control family-wise error rate and false discovery rate using methods like the Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg corrections.\n",
    "   - Best Practices: Recommendations for calculating sample sizes, documenting methodologies, and presenting data clearly with distribution plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Causation vs. Correlation:\n",
    "   - Differentiating correlation from causation, with examples on confounding factors in observational studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Interventional Studies:\n",
    "   - Introducing Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) as a standard for establishing causation, especially in social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file covers essential elements and practical advice for hypothesis testing, addressing common pitfalls and emphasizing rigor in experimental design.\n",
